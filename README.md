# particles.jsx
## an unoptimised particle system

I created this mainly as a react challenge and thought it could be slightly useful to someone or people could update it to make it slightly better.

known bugs:
- it doesnt have any form of delta time making it very unstable and unpredicatble.
- svg box-shadow is square not circular to match particle shape.
- when resizing window, particles dont reset properlly.

you can find source code in the dev branch.
